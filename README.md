# Loan Default Risk Segmentation & Actionability Dashboard
This project simulates a real-world credit risk analysis pipeline for financial institutions. Using fully synthetic data (to avoid privacy concerns), it demonstrates how credit analysts can:
	•	Generate realistic borrower data with loan, income, credit score, and risk attributes.
	•	Visualize risk patterns across credit scores, loan types, city tiers, and debt-to-income levels.
	•	Train predictive models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest) to estimate default probabilities.
	•	Interpret model results using SHAP to understand feature importance and individual risk drivers.
	•	Segment customers into risk tiers (Red, Yellow, Green) based on predicted probabilities.
	•	Recommend targeted actions for each risk segment to drive smarter credit decisions.

# Key Features
	•	Synthetic dataset with 5,000+ realistic loan records (age, credit score, DTI, EMI, etc.)
	•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with heatmaps, bar charts, and summary statistics
	•	Predictive modeling with ROC AUC, classification reports, and SHAP explainability
	•	Scenario-based risk simulations to test income, credit score, and DTI improvements
	•	Risk tiering and dashboard-ready visualizations for business strategy alignment
